# scrappy
A small, crappy text editor. Maybe it'll grow up to be a real boy.

# License
MIT. I'm trying to get a license file added.

# Current features
It can manipulate the clipboard, read and write files, and has an about screen.

# Upcoming features
I don't want to write anything here, it's just guaranteed to become out-of-date. Check the issues and milestones.

# Why should I use this editor?
If you have to ask, you probably shouldn't.
