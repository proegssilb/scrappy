# scrappy

A small, crappy text editor. Maybe it'll grow up to be a real boy.

# Project state

Currently, scrappy can manipulate the clipboard, read and write files, and has
an about screen.

This project uses a variation of Semantic Versioning. Versions below 1.0 do not
track breaking changes. There will be a system for automatically identifying
breaking changes before this project hits 1.0, but it isn't here yet.

# Why should I use this editor?

If you have to ask, you probably shouldn't.
